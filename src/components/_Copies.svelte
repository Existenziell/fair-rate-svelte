<h1>Uniform Residential Loan Application</h1>
<p>
  This application is designed to be completed by the applicant(s) with the
  Lender’s assistance. Applicants should complete this form as “Borrower” or
  “Co-Borrower,” as applicable. Co-Borrower information must also be provided
  (and the appropriate box checked) when  the income or assets of a person other
  than the Borrower (including the Borrower’s spouse) will be used as a basis
  for loan qualification or  the income or assets of the Borrower’s spouse or
  other person who has community property rights pursuant to state law will not
  be used as a basis for loan qualification, but his or her liabilities must be
  considered because the spouse or other person has community property rights
  pursuant to applicable law and Borrower resides in a community property state,
  the security property is located in a community property state, or the
  Borrower is relying on other property located in a community property state as
  a basis for repayment of the loan.
